# health-bot
A Twitch.tv bot that displays gamer related health issues.

## Motivation
As an avid lover of video games, I am fully aware of the health issues that arise from prolonged gaming session. 
Bad posture, eye strain, wrist aches are some examples of preventable damage. HealthBot's goal is to inform and remind
gamers to take care of their bodies.

## Next Steps
1. Create more commands
2. Provide more health facts
3. Launch bot to public

## What I learned
- How to use the Twitch IRC API
- Gamer health risks
- OOP in Python
